# Release v0.3.0

**Release Date**: 2025-12-08

## Overview

v0.3.0 is a significant feature release that introduces the AI Rules system, enabling AI programming assistants (such as CodeBuddy, Cursor, etc.) to understand how to use devgen tools and provide more accurate code suggestions.

## New Features

### AI Rules System

Added `devgen rules` command to generate rule files that AI programming assistants can understand.

**List supported AI Agents:**
```bash
devgen rules --list-agents
```

**Preview Rules content:**
```bash
devgen rules --agent codebuddy
```

**Generate Rules files:**
```bash
devgen rules --agent codebuddy -w
```

Generated rule files are located in the `.codebuddy/rules/` directory, including:
- `enumgen.md` - Enum code generation tool usage guide
- `validategen.md` - Struct validation code generation tool usage guide
- `devgen.md` - devgen comprehensive usage guide
- `devgen-plugin.md` - Plugin development guide
- `devgen-genkit.md` - genkit API reference
- `devgen-rules.md` - AI Rules system documentation

### RuleTool Interface

Plugin developers can implement the `RuleTool` interface to provide AI Rules for custom plugins:

```go
type RuleTool interface {
    Tool
    Rules() []Rule
}

type Rule struct {
    Name        string   // Rule file name (without extension)
    Description string   // Brief description
    Globs       []string // File matching patterns
    AlwaysApply bool     // Whether to always load
    Content     string   // Rule content (Markdown)
}
```

### VSCode Extension Enhancements

- Added `devgen.generateRules` command to generate AI Rules directly in the IDE
- Supports automatic detection of the current workspace and generates corresponding rule files

## Improvements

### Logger Enhancements

- Added `Logger.Warnf()` method for warning messages
- Added `Logger.Debugf()` method for debug messages
- Optimized log output format with color highlighting

## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading from v0.2.x

Direct upgrade with no breaking changes:

```bash
go install github.com/tlipoca9/devgen/cmd/devgen@v0.3.0
```

### Generate AI Rules

After upgrading, run the following command to generate AI Rules:

```bash
devgen rules --agent codebuddy -w
```

Then commit the generated `.codebuddy/rules/` directory to version control so that all team members can benefit from AI-assisted programming.
